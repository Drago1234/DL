# Recurrent Neural Network

## Intro to RNN

Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network architecture specially suited for handling sequences such as text, and audio. 

Build a character-wise RNN trained on Anna Karenina. It'll be able to generate new text based on the text from the book.

This network is based off of Andrej Karpathy's [post on RNNs](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and [implementation in Torch](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn). Also, some information [here at r2rt](http://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-ii.html) and from [Sherjil Ozair](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow) on GitHub.
