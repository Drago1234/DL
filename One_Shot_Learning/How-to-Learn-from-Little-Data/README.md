# One Shot Learning using Memory-Augmented Neural Networks in Tensorflow

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/tChcZpBbTTA) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. We're going to use a [Memory Augmented Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065) in Tensorflow to perform one-shot learning on the omniglot dataset. That means we'll be able to classify images by their labels after training on just a few samples. 

The benchmark dataset is [Omniglot dataset](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot).
