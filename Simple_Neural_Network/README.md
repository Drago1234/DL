# Simple Neural Network
Build a simple neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. 

1. Load and prepare the data

2. Data exploration

3. Build the network:

	* Implement the sigmoid function to use as the activation function. 
	* Implement the forward pass in the train method.
	* Implement the backpropagation algorithm in the train method, including calculating the output error.
	* Implement the forward pass in the run method.

4. Train the network

5. Test
