# Reinforcement Learning

Build a neural network that can learn to play games through reinforcement learning. More specifically, we'll use Q-learning to train an agent to play a game called [Cart-Pole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0). In this game, a freely swinging pole is attached to a cart. The cart can move to the left and right, and the goal is to keep the pole upright as long as possible.

We can simulate this game using [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).
