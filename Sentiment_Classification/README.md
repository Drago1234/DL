# Sentiment Classification



## Sentiment analysis with TFLearn

Building a network for sentiment analysis on the movie review data. Instead of a network written with Numpy, we'll be using [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/), a high-level library built on top of TensorFlow. TFLearn makes it simpler to build networks just by defining the layers. It takes care of most of the details for you.
