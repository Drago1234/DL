# How_to_make_a_chatbot

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/t5qgjJIBy9g) video by Siraj Raval on Youtube as part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. This code is actually an end-to-end memory network, since there doesn't yet exist a 'dynamic' memory network implementation in Keras. For an example of a 'dynamic' memory network see [this](https://github.com/ethancaballero/Improved-Dynamic-Memory-Networks-DMN-plus) repository. 

### Dependencies

* tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
* functools
* tarfile
* re

### Usage

Run `python memorynetwork.py` in terminal and the code will begin training.
