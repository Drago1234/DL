# how_to_generate_video

This is the code for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E2N1kQc8MM&feature=youtu.be) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree with Udacity. This code uses Keras with a Tensorflow backend to train a [Generative Adversarial Network](https://www.google.com/search?q=generative+adversarial+network&oq=gener&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61j69i60l2j69i59j69i61.547j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to generate new images of the [alien language](http://blog.wolfram.com/2017/01/31/analyzing-and-translating-an-alien-language-arrival-logograms-and-the-wolfram-language/) from the movie Arrival. We can stich those images together to create short videos as well.
